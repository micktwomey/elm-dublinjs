# What is Elm?

> The best of functional programming in your browser
-- elm-lang.org

---

# Full Programming Language

- A new programming language for frontend development
- Strongly Typed (in a good way)
- ML inspired (try saying Hindleyâ€“Milner three times fast!)
- Compiler is your friend (really!)

---

# Compiles to Javascript

- Full compiler toolchain (written in Haskell)
- Emits a single .js file you can include and run, no other dependencies
- Can treat the output like a library

---

# A Taste of Elm

[HelloWorld.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelloWorld.elm)

```haskell
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)

main : Element
main =
  show "Hello World"
```

---

# A Centred Taste of Elm

[HelloWorldCentre.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelloWorldCentre.elm)

```haskell
import Graphics.Element exposing (..)
import Window

main : Signal Element
main =
  Signal.map view Window.dimensions

view : ( Int, Int ) -> Element
view ( width, height ) =
  container width height middle (hello)
```

---

# A Bigger Taste of Elm

[HelloWorldBig.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelloWorldBig.elm)

```haskell
hello : Element
hello =
  Text.fromString "Hello, World!"
    |> Text.bold
    |> Text.height 72
    |> leftAligned
```

---

# Side Note: Language Design is a Hard Balance

![inline](indiana_mouse.jpg)

---

# Elm Philosophy (paraphrasing)

- Make a language for front end programmers
- Ambitious: be both more maintainable and easier to use than Javascript (and more fun!)
- Not convinced gradual typing will get us to a good place
- Watch [Evan Czaplicki - Let's be mainstream! User focused design in Elm - Curry On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE) for more

---

# Some Party Tricks

- Nice Type System (really!)
- Helpful compiler error messages
- Time travelling debugger
- No runtime exceptions [^1]
- Semantic package versioning baked in

[^1]: You can call Debug.crash to get one if you want

---

## Compiler: Spot the Typo

[HelpfulCompiler1.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelpfulCompiler1.elm)

```haskell
type alias Model = { title : String }

init : Model
init = { title = "Foo" }

update : Model -> Model
update model = { model | tite = "Bar" }

main : Element
main = show (update init)
```

---

---

## Spot the "Type"-o

[HelpfulCompiler2.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelpfulCompiler2.elm)

```haskell
showMessage : String -> Element
showMessage message =
  show message

main : Element
main =
  showMessage 1234
```


---

---

## Learning via the Compiler

[HelpfulCompiler3.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelpfulCompiler3.elm)

```haskell
main : Element
main =
  show ("Hello " + "World!")
```

---

![original fit](elm-compiler-error-3.png)

---

## Hard to Express Incorrect Code

[HelpfulCompiler4.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/HelpfulCompiler4.elm)

```haskell
type Action
  = Left
  | Right

act : Action -> String
act action =
  case action of
    Left -> "Goto fail, I mean, going left!"

main : Element
main =
  show (act Right)
```

# Semantic Versioning

```
$ elm package diff evancz/elm-html 3.0.0 4.0.2
Comparing evancz/elm-html 3.0.0 to 4.0.2...
This is a MAJOR change.

------ Changes to module Html.Attributes - MAJOR ------

    Removed:
        boolProperty : String -> Bool -> Attribute
        stringProperty : String -> String -> Attribute


------ Changes to module Html.Events - MINOR ------

    Added:
        type alias Options =
            { stopPropagation : Bool, preventDefault : Bool }
        defaultOptions : Html.Events.Options
        onWithOptions : String -> Html.Events.Options -> Json.Decode.Decoder a -> (a -> Signal.Message) -> Html.Attribute
```

^ Uses types to determine if package change major or a minor release
^ Won't allow you to release without revving the version correctly
^ Can diff packages

---

# Caveats

- Language still evolving, so can change with each major release [^3]
- Interop with other JS might surprise you at first

[^3]: e.g. in 0.15.1 to 0.16.0 a bunch of syntax around records was removed to simplify

---

# Integrating with Javascript

- Can embed elm app in pages
- Use ports to communicate
- Can rewrite everything in Elm [^4]
- (Tangent: "native")

[^4]: My favourite approach :smile:

^ Native Similar to C extensions in other languages
^ Some parts of Elm libraries implemented as "native" extensions

---

# Ports

```haskell
port addUser : Signal (String, UserRecord)

port requestUser : Signal String
port requestUser =
    signalOfUsersWeWantMoreInfoOn
```

^ Declare what can go in and out

---

```javascript
myapp.ports.addUser.send([
    "Tom",
    { age: 32, job: "lumberjack" }
]);

myapp.ports.requestUser.subscribe(databaseLookup);
function databaseLookup(user) {
    var userInfo = database.lookup(user);
    myapp.ports.addUser.send(user, userInfo);
}
```

^ Call port with correct values, incorrect types are rejected

# Bonus: WebGL GLSL Compiler for Free!

[thwomp.elm](http://localhost:8000/examples/thwomp.elm?debug)

```haskell
vertexShader : Shader { attr | position:Vec3, color:Vec3 }
                      { unif | rotation:Mat4, perspective:Mat4, camera:Mat4 }
                      { vcolor:Vec3 }
vertexShader = [glsl|
attribute vec3 position;
attribute vec3 color;
uniform mat4 perspective;
uniform mat4 camera;
uniform mat4 rotation;
varying vec3 vcolor;
void main () {
    gl_Position = perspective * camera * rotation * vec4(position, 1.0);
    vcolor = color;
}
|]
```

# Lot's of Nice Stuff

- Useful, strong types and a helpful compiler (thanks ML!)
- Hard to express bad code
- Needs way less tests!
- Fun!
- Time travelling debugger
- Semantic package versioning
- Can use it today!

---

# Lot's More Stuff I Didn't Talk About

- Reactive programming (Effects, Tasks, Signals)
- Re-usable components with Elm's architecture
- Fast virtual DOM
- Nice canvas graphics
- No undefined / NULL / None !

---

# Finally: My Favourite Feature

> Elm has been my most successful (and fun!) attempt to learn Functional Programming yet
-- Me

- Elm is like a gateway drug to functional programming (and ML languages like F#, Haskell and OCaml)
- Even if you don't wind up using it professionally you have fun learning
